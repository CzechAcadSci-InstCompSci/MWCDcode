# MWCD code version 1.0

Computation of the minimum weighted covariance determinant (MWCD) estimator

The code in Matlab allows to compute the minimum weighted covariance determinant (MWCD) estimator proposed by Roelant (2009). This is a robust estimator of parameters of a multivariate dataset with a (possibly) high breakdown point. 

Feel free to use or modify the code.

## Requirements

You need the file fastlts.m to run the full code, which compares the MWCD with the 
minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator.

## Usage

 * mainMwcd.m
	Main file, which reads an external data file, runs the estimates for the classical 
estimates (i.e. maximum likelihood for Gaussian data), MCD and MWCD estimators,
and presents their results. It also presents the resulting MWCD estimator graphically.

 * mwcdCheck.m
         The function for computing the MWCD estimator for the given dataset.
